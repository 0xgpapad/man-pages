Global changes
--------------

Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
from Fabian Kreutz.

Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently 
translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and 
Andries Brouwer.

For consistency, all instances "super-user" were changed to the more 
common "superuser".

After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.  

    In addition:
        -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
           on various pages.

        -- types such as "uint" in syscalN() declarations were changed
           to "unsigned int", etc.

        -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

   The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.
