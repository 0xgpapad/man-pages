Global changes
--------------

Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
from Fabian Kreutz.

Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently 
translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and 
Andries Brouwer.

For consistency, all instances "super-user" were changed to the more 
common "superuser".

After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.  

    In addition:
        -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
           on various pages.

        -- types such as "uint" in syscalN() declarations were changed
           to "unsigned int", etc.

        -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

   The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Global changes
--------------

Matthew Dempsky, mtk
    triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
    The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in the
    following pages:

            accept.2
            close.2
            send.2
            setsid.2
            socket.2
            closedir.3
            initgroups.3
            mkstemp.3
            opendir.3
            readdir.3
            telldir.3

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Individual pages
----------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to 
            2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
            on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
   as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
       Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)"

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack <grendel@debian.org>
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443
        
strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538
                
strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..0.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says 
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 -- 
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the 
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg / http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon 
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros <sytdlib.h> 
        as for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behaviour
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.

Global changes
--------------

Martin (Joey) Schulze
    Removed SEE ALSO reference to non-existent newctime(3) from:

        ctime.3
        tzselect.8
        zdump.8
        zic.8

        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Individual pages
----------------

clone.2
    mtk
        Noted the PID caching behaviour of NPTL's getpid()
        wrapper under BUGS.

        Added futex(2), set_thread_area(2), set_tid_address(2), 
        tkill(2) under SEE ALSO.

epoll_ctl.2
epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and 
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version where posix_fadvise() appeared and
        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

    Michael Haardt
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to rename
        a file across mount points, even if the mount points refer to 
        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

setitimer.2
    Matthias Lang, mtk
        Noted MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES ceiling.
        Added note about treatment of out-of-range tv_usec values.

sigqueue.2
    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behaviour: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy() does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

man.7
    Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.org>
    Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with 
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to 
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by 
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be 
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts: 
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and 
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts 
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without 
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections 
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7 
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh 
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).

Global changes
--------------

Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in 
man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has 
been removed where it occurred.

Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Changes to individual pages

    mtk
        Added EINVAL error for rlim_cur > rlim_max when calling setrlimit().

        is nowadays.

mlock.2
    mtk
        Reworded text around PAGESIZE, noting also that 
        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
   mtk / aeb
       Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
       "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
       since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
       the effective UID is not.

       Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of 
       it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file 
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file 
        system GID.

        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers

    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert@gondor.apana.org.au
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text 
            explaining that some systems need the former header.
            As per Debian bug 265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-11-03

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Function and page cross references that were italicised were made bold
(which is how the majority of function and page cross references 
were already done).

Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
"null-terminated string".

Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were bold 
were changed to italics.

Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made 
unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
formatted.)

places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
         This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
         (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are 
         the same.)
         See also Debian bug 336875.
         
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.
        In response to Debian bug 339037.

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Brüns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that that frexp() returns a number whose 
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example 
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2 
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to Debian bug 339037.

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some 
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for 
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the page said that all systems declare memalign() in 
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angelo pointed out 
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze    
        Remove SEE ALSO for non-existent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.
