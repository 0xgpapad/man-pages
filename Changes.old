Global changes
--------------

Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
from Fabian Kreutz.

Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently 
translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and 
Andries Brouwer.

For consistency, all instances "super-user" were changed to the more 
common "superuser".

After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.  

    In addition:
        -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
           on various pages.

        -- types such as "uint" in syscalN() declarations were changed
           to "unsigned int", etc.

        -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

   The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Global changes
--------------

Matthew Dempsky, mtk
    triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
    The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in the
    following pages:

            accept.2
            close.2
            send.2
            setsid.2
            socket.2
            closedir.3
            initgroups.3
            mkstemp.3
            opendir.3
            readdir.3
            telldir.3

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Individual pages
----------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to 
            2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
            on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
   as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
       Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)"

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack <grendel@debian.org>
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443
        
strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538
                
strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..0.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says 
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 -- 
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the 
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg / http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon 
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros <sytdlib.h> 
        as for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behaviour
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.
