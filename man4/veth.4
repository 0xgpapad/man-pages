.SH NAME
veth \- Virtual Ethernet Device
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B veth
devices are virtual Ethernet devices.
.PP
They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create
a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but
can also be used as standalone network devices.
.PP
Because of their original purpose for tunneling
.B veth
devices are always created in pairs, that are
interconnected with each other.
When one
.B veth
end receives a packet it appears on its pair and vice versa.
.PP
.B Veth
devices can be manipulated with the
.BR ip (8)
tool.
See
.I "ip link help"
for more information.
