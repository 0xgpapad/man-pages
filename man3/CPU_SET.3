.TH CPU_SET 2 2008-11-12 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
CPU_CLR, CPU_ISSET, CPU_SET, CPU_ZERO, CPU_COUNT \-
macros for manipulating CPU sets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #define _GNU_SOURCE
.B #include <sched.h>
.sp
.BI "void CPU_CLR(int " cpu ", cpu_set_t *" set );
.br
.BI "int CPU_ISSET(int " cpu ", cpu_set_t *" set );
.br
.BI "void CPU_SET(int " cpu ", cpu_set_t *" set );
.br
.BI "void CPU_ZERO(cpu_set_t *" set );
.br
.BI "void CPU_COUNT(cpu_set_t *" set );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cpu_set_t
data structure represents a set of CPUs.
CPU sets are used by
.BR sched_setaffinity (2)
and similar interfaces.

The following macros are provided to operate on the CPU set
.IR set :
.TP 16
.BR CPU_ZERO ()
clears
.I set
so that it contains no CPUs.
.TP
.BR CPU_SET ()
adds CPU
.I cpu
to
.IR set .
.TP
.BR CPU_CLR ()
removes CPU
.I cpu
from
.IR set .
.TP
.BR CPU_ISSET ()
tests to see if CPU
.I cpu
is a member of
.IR set .
.TP
.BR CPU_COUNT ()
returns the number of CPUs in
.IR set .
.PP
Where a
.I cpu
argument is specified, it should not produce side effects,
since the above macros may evaluate the argument more than once.
.PP
The first available CPU on the system corresponds to a
.I cpu
value of 0, the next CPU corresponds to a
.I cpu
value of 1, and so on.
The constant
.B CPU_SETSIZE
(1024) specifies a value one greater than the maximum CPU
number that can be stored in a CPU set.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR CPU_ISSET ()
returns non-zero if
.I cpu
is in
.IR set ;
otherwise, it returns 0.

.BR CPU_COUNT ()
returns the number of CPUs in
.IR set .

The other functions do not return a value.
.\" .SH ERRORS
.\" AFAICT, no E* errors are occur.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR CPU_ZERO (),
.BR CPU_CLR (),
.BR CPU_SET (),
and
.BR CPU_ISSET ()
macros were added in glibc 2.3.3.

.BR CPU_COUNT ()
first appeared in glibc 2.6.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
These interfaces are Linux-specific.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR sched_setaffinity (2),
.BR CPU_SET (3),
.BR pthread_attr_setaffinity_np (3),
.BR pthread_setaffinity_np (3),
.BR cpuset (7)
