.sp
.BR sigsetjmp ():
_POSIX_C_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR setjmp ()
and
.BR longjmp (3)
are useful for dealing with errors
and interrupts encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.
.BR setjmp ()
saves the stack context/environment in \fIenv\fP for
later use by
.BR longjmp (3).
The stack context will be invalidated
if the function which called
.BR setjmp ()
returns.
.P
.BR sigsetjmp ()
is similar to
.BR setjmp ().
If \fIsavesigs\fP is non-zero,
the set of blocked signals is saved in \fIenv\fP and will be restored
if a
.BR siglongjmp (3)
is later performed with this \fIenv\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR setjmp ()
and
.BR sigsetjmp ()
return 0 if returning directly, and
non-zero when returning from
.BR longjmp (3)
using the saved context.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C89, C99, and POSIX.1-2001 specify
.BR setjmp ().
POSIX.1-2001 specifies
.BR sigsetjmp ().
.SH NOTES
POSIX does not specify whether
.BR setjmp ()
will save the
signal context.
(In System V it will not.
In 4.3BSD it will, and there
is a function \fB_setjmp\fP that will not.)
If you want to save signal masks, use
.BR sigsetjmp ().
.P
.BR setjmp ()
and
.BR sigsetjmp ()
make programs hard to understand
and maintain.
If possible an alternative should be used.
