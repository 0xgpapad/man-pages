These are some things that should get done for man-pages, one day.

Mailing lists
=============

Set up mailing lists for the manual pages:

* A low-volume, broadcast list announcing new manual page releases,
  and other events of similar significance.

* A general discussion list used for submitting manual page suggestions,
  fixes, etc.

Website
=======

Set up a website for the man-pages project.  Aside from describing the 
project, and how to contribute to it, the site should also:

* provide hyperlinked versions of the manual pages
* provide a web interface to the subversion repository in which 
  the manual pages have been maintained since version 2.00
* provide a (searchable) archive of the mailing lists

Once the web site is up, it may be worthwhile putting its URL into 
the header or footer of every manual page; this would allow people
to easily determine where to submit bug reports and suggestions.

Bugzilla
========

Set up a bugzilla for reporting bugs in the manual pages.

Markup language
===============

The existing man-pages set is an unfortunate mixture pages written in 
two formats: 'man' and 'mdoc' (BSD).  Neither is optimal, since they
don't encode sufficient semantic detail about the elements of a page.
What is required is a new markup language (probably some form of 
docbook) that:

a) is unintrusive: the raw page source should remain very readable
b) applies markup by function, not by effect
c) can be easily processed to generate the present nroff from it
d) can be easily processed to generate HTML from it
e) be simple to learn and use

And of course, the existing pages would need to be converted to 
the new format.

A big job...

Devise a style guide
====================

This should describe formatting, terminology and grammar conventions.
While we're at it, we probably better standardise on one version
of English spelling.
