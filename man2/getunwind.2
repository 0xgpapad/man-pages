.TH GETUNWIND 2 "29 August 2006" Linux "Linux System Calls"
.SH NAME
getunwind \- copy the unwind data to caller's buffer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <syscall.h>
.B #include <linux/unwind.h>
.sp
.BI "long getunwind (void " *buf ", size_t " buf_size );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sys_getunwind
function returns size of unwind table, which describes gate page (kernel code that
is mapped into user space).

The unwind data is copied to the buffer \fIbuf\fR, which has size \fIbuf_size\fR.
The data is copied
only if \fIbuf_size\fR is greater than or equal to the size of the 
unwind data and \fIbuf\fR is not NULL.
The system call returns the size of the unwind data in both cases.

The first part of the unwind data contains an unwind table. 
The rest contains the associated unwind info in random order.
The unwind table contains a table looking like:

.nf
	u64 start;      (64-bit address of start of function)
	u64 end;        (64-bit address of start of function)
	u64 info;       (BUF-relative offset to unwind info)
.fi

An entry with a START address of zero is the end of table.
For more information about the format you can see the IA-64 
Software Conventions and Runtime Architecture.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.B sys_getunwind
function returns size of unwind table.

.SH ERRORS
The
.B sys_getunwind
function fails with
.B EFAULT
if the unwind info can't be stored in the space specified by
the
.I buf 
argument.

.SH AVAILABILITY
This system call is available only on the IA-64 architecture.

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
This system call has been deprecated. It's highly recommended to get at the kernel's
unwind info by the gate DSO. The address of the ELF header for this DSO
is passed to user level via AT_SYSINFO_EHDR.

The system call is not available to application programs as a function;
it can be called using the
.BR syscall (2)
function.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR syscall(2),
