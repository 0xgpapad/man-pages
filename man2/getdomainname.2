.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to access or to change the domain name of the
current processor.
If the null-terminated domain name requires more than \fIlen\fP bytes,
.BR getdomainname ()
returns the first \fIlen\fP bytes (glibc) or returns an error (libc).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
For
.BR setdomainname ():
.I name
pointed outside of user address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
For
.BR getdomainname ()
under libc:
.I name
is NULL or
.I name
is longer than
.I len
bytes.
.TP
.B EINVAL
For
.BR setdomainname ():
.I len
was negative or too large.
.TP
.B EPERM

.BR setdomainname ():
the caller is unprivileged (Linux: does not have the
