Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Removed pages
-------------

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place to go
	for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

exec.3
    mtk
        Removed FILES section, since it seems to provide no useful info.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling 
	open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being 
	equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note 
	about this historical behaviour.

mremap.2
    mtk
        Remove text about the non-existent BSD meremap() -- too
	much information, in my opinion.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

atexit.3
    mtk
        Small rearrangement of text under NOTES.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).
