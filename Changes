Global changes
--------------

gettimeofday.2
madvise.2
msgctl.2
select.2
semctl.2
shmctl.2
stat.2
a64l.3
printf.3
termios.3
xdr.3
sd.4
    mtk
        Minor wording changes.

obsolete.2
syscall.2
unimplemented.2
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO reference to syscalls.2.



New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
	(This page replaces a previous link of the same, which linked
	signal.2.)


Removed Pages
-------------

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
	respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
	to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
	is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other 
	places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
	is a killpg.2.


New links
---------

chown32.2
fchown32.2
getegid32.2
geteuid32.2
getgid32.2
getgroups32.2
getresgid32.2
getresuid32.2
getuid32.2
lchown32.2
setfsgid32.2
setfsuid32.2
setgid32.2
setgroups32.2
setregid32.2
setresgid32.2
setresuid32.2
setreuid32.2
setuid32.2

        Added as link to corresponding page without "32".

fadvise64_64.2
    mtk
        Links to posix_fadvise.2.

rt_sigaction.2
rt_sigpending.2
rt_sigprocmask.2
rt_sigtimedwait.2
    mtk
        Added as link to corresponding page without "rt_" prefix.

rt_sigqueueinfo.2
    mtk
        Link to sigqueue.2.

mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2

        Added as links to corresponding section 3 pages.
