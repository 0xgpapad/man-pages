Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

acct.2
    mtk
        Add a few more words to DESCRIPTION.
	NOTES: Add pointer to acct(5).

alarm.2
    Alain Portal
        s/process/calling process/ so as to that the alarm signal is
	delivered to the calling process.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Clarify description of chmod() and fchmod().
	Add further detail on S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX permissions.
	Reformat list of permissions bits.

chown.2
    mtk
        Describe rules governing ownership of new files (bsdgroups
	versus sysvgroups, and the effect of the parent directory's
	set-group-ID permission bit).

chroot.2
    Alain Portal
        Clarify description a little.
	s/changes the root directory/
	  changes the root directory of the calling process/

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Peter Zijlstra
        Add description of RLIMIT_RTTIME limit, new in 2.6.25.

open.2
    mtk, after a note from Christoph hellwig
        NOTES: Note that access mode flags are not single bits,
	and document the Linuxism "access mode 3".
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/653123.

mknod.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
	(possibly dangling) symbolic link.

dprintf.3
    mtk
        Note that these functions are included in the next POSIX revision.
	Remove editorial discussion about what the functions should have
	been named.

getaddrinfo.3
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add hostname(7).

getmntent.3
    mtk, after Stuart Cunningham pointed out the typo
        Remove statement that LSB deprecates the functions
	"endmntent(), setmntent() [sic] and setmntent()".
	This doesn't seem to be true (I can't find mention of
	deprecation in any of the LSB specs).  Rather, LSB simply
	doesn't specify these functions.  (LSB 1.3 had a spec of
	setmntent(), but not getmntent() or endmntent(), and noted
	that having a spec of setmntent() was of little use without
	also having a spec of getmntent().)
	See also https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/\
	lsb-discuss/2006-October/003078.html

mkfifo.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
	(possibly dangling) symbolic link.

remainder.3
    mtk
        Recommend against drem(), in favor of remainder().

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Enhanced description of VERSIONS section.
        
mq_overview.7
   mtk
        Note that Linux does not currently support ACLs for POSIX
	message queues.

sem_overview.7
    mtk
        Note that Linux supports ACLs on POSIX named semaphores
	since 2.6.19.

unix.7
    mtk, after a note by Samuel Thibault
        Provide a clear description of the three types of address that
	can appear in the sockaddr_un structure: pathname, unnamed,
	and abstract.
