Global changes
--------------

There was a major reworking of the CONFORMING TO sections
in most manual pages.
    mtk

    * generally try to rationalise the names used for standards.
      The preferred names are now documented as the head words
      of the list in standards(7).  For the future: there is
      probably no need to talk about anything more than
      C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001 (or later), xBSD, and SVr4.
      (In particular, I've eliminated most references to XPG
      and SVID, replacing them with references to SUS or SVr4.)

    * eliminate discussion of errors that can occur on other
      systems.  This information exists only patchily in the
      manual pages, is probably of limited use, is hard to maintain, 
      and was in some cases simply wrong (and probably always was).

    * Tried to ensure that those interfaces specified in C99 or 
      POSIX.1-2001 are marked as such in their manual pages.
