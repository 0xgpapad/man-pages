Global changes
--------------

The terms "set-user-ID" and "set-group-ID" are now used consistently
(no abbreviations) across all manual pages.

Consistent use of "saved set-user-ID" and "saved set-group-ID"
(no more "saved user ID", "ved effective UID", saved group ID", etc.)

Global fixes in textual descriptions:

        uid --> UID
        gid --> GID
        pid --> PID
        id --> ID

Consistent use of st_atime, st_ctime, st_mtime, with explanatory text, 
instead of atime/ctime/mtime.

Classical BSD versions are now always named x.yBSD (formerly
there was a mix of x.yBSD and BSD x.y).

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.
