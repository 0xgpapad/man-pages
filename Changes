Global changes
--------------

Martin (Joey) Schulze
    Removed SEE ALSO reference to non-existent ctime(3) from:

        ctime.3
        tzselect.8
        zdump.8
        zic.8

        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Individual pages
----------------

clone.2
    mtk
        Noted the PID caching behaviour of NPTL's getpid()
        wrapper under BUGS.

        Added futex(2), set_thread_area(2), set_tid_address(2), 
        tkill(2) under SEE ALSO.

epoll_ctl.2
epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and 
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version where posix_fadvise() appeared and
        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

rename.2
    Michael Haardt
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to rename
        a file across mount points, even if the mount points refer to 
        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

setitimer.2
    Matthias Lang, mtk
        Noted MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES ceiling.
        Added note about treatment of out-of-range tv_usec values.

sigqueue.2
    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behaviour: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

strcasestr.3
    mtk
        Created as link to strstr.3.

strftime.3
    mtk
        Noted that SUSv2 allowed a range of 00 to 61 for %S specifier.

strstr.3
    mtk
        Added description of strcasestr().

random.4
    aeb
        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

man.7
    Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.org>
    Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>
    Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>
        Mention the .URL macro more verbosely.
