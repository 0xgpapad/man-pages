New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting lio_listio(3)

kexec_load.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting kexec_load(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add license
    Michael Kerrisk
        Incorporate fixes from Eric W. Biederman
            Eric noted that a few instances of "virtual" should
            be "physical" and noted:

                There is an expectation that at hand off from sys_kexec that
                virtual and physical addresses will be identity mapped. But
                this isn't the old Alpha booting convention where you have
                a virtual address and then you have to parse the page table
                to figure out where your kernel was actually loaded.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Additions and edits by mtk
            Various wording and layout improvements.
            Fixed the name of a constant: s/KEXEC_ARCH_I386/KEXEC_ARCH_386/.
            Added RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections.
            Added VERSIONS section
            Note that CONFIG_KEXEC is needed
            Removed details of using syscall; the reader can find them in
            syscall(2).
            Added some details for KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT.
            Revised the text mentioning the kernel header, since it is
            not yet exported, and it's not certain that it will be.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages

            You don't have anything from the old network namespace in
            the new one. Even the loopback device is new.

            preparation for the new flags to be documented.

Various pages

        Add reference to feature_test_macros(7)
            Some pages simply list feature test macro requirements in
            the form:

                #define #GNU_SOURCE
                #include <someheader.h>

            For these pages, add a "See feature_test_macros(7)" comment
            on the "#define" line.

    David Prevot
        Fix special character names
            Comparing to koi8-u.7, I noticed some inconsistencies in special
            character names. After checking with the following Unicode related
            pages, please find inline (and gzipped attached, hopefully not
            messing with encoding), a patch in order to make it right, on an
            Unicode point of view.

            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf

koi8-r.7
    David Prevot
        Fix SEE ALSO reference and letter names
            The koi8-r(7) (Russian Net Character Set) manual page refers to
            iso-8859-7(7) manual page, which is the Latin/Greek one. I guess it
            should refer instead to the iso-8859-5(7) (Latin/Cyrillic) one. This is
            addressed at the end of the patch.

            It has also been spotted that letter names are different in this manual
            page and in the Unicode related page [0], the first part of the page
            address this.
