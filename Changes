Global changes
--------------

The POSIX.1 man pages (sections 0p, 1p, 3p) have been moved out
of this package into the separate man-pages-posix package.
This made sense because those pages are seldom changed (only formatting
fixes, etc.) so that it was unnecessary to redistribute them with each
man-pages release.

        s/`/\`/ for backquotes used in command substitution, for
        proper rendering in UTF-8.

Various pages
    mtk, after a note from Stuart Brady
        Using /'x'/ to denote a character (string) renders poorly in
        UTF-8, where the two ' characters render as closing single
        quotes.  On the other hand, using /`x'/ renders nicely on UTF-8,
        where proper opening and closing single quotes are produced by
        groff(1), but looks ugly when rendered in ASCII.  Using the
        sequence /\\aqx\\aq/ produces a reasonable rendering ('\\aq'
        is a vertical "apostrophe quote") in both UTF-8 and ASCII.
        So that change is made in a number of pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Replace form /`string'/ by /"string"/, since the former renders
        poorly in ASCII.
