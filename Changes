Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
         This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
         (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are 
         the same.)
         See also Debian bug 336875.
         
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.
        In response to Debian bug 339037.

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Brüns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that that frexp() returns a number whose 
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example 
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2 
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to Debian bug 339037.

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some 
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for 
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the pge said that all systems declare memalign() in 
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angleo pointed out 
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze    
        Remove SEE ALSO for non-existent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.

signal.7
    mtk
        Added pthreads.7 to SEE ALSO.
        
ld.so.8
    mtk
        Fix typo: s/LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT/LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT/
