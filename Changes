==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-??-??

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Function and page cross references that were italicised were made bold
(which is how the majority of function and page cross references 
were already done).

Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
"null-terminated string".

Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were bold 
were changed to italics.

Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made 
unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
formatted.)
