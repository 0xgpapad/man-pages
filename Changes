Global changes
--------------

bdflush.2
inotify_add_watch.2
mprotect.2
sigprocmask.2
ctime.3
getusershell.3
setbuf.3
st.4
ip.7
packet.7
    mtk
        Replace "(il)legal" by "permitted" or "valid".

read.2
utime.2
filesystems.5
packet.7
    mtk
        s/time stamp/timestamp/, for consistency with majority use
	in other pages, and in POSIX.1.

Various pages
    mtk
        Various pages that I wrote carried a slightly modified version
	of the "verbatim" license.  In the interests of minimizing
	lincense proliferation, I've reverted the modified form
       	so that the license is exactly the same as on other pages
	carrying the verbatim license.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several places.


New pages
---------

random_r.3
    mtk, after a suggestion by aeb
        Documents random_r(3), srandom_r(3), initstate_r(32), and
	setstate_r(3), which are the reentrant equivalents of
	random(3), srandom(3), initstate(3), and setstate(3).


New links
---------

lutimes.3
    mtk
        Link to futimes.3.

initstate_r.3
setstate_r.3
srandom_r.3
    mtk
        Links to random_r.3.

daylight.3
timezone.3
tzname.3
    mtk
        Links to tzset.3.

isnanf.3
isnanl.3
    mtk
        Links to finite.3.

encrypt_r.3
setkey_r.3
    mtk
        Links to encrypt.3.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Added portability note to BUGS text for EPOLL_CTL_DEL.

mount.2
    mtk
        Minor wording change.

sched_setscheduler.2
    mtk, with input from Ingo Molnar
        Add description of SCHED_IDLE policy (new in 2.6.23).
	Tweak description of SCHED_BATCH.

setpriority.2
    mtk, after a note from Ingo Molnar
        Add text in NOTES about the punchier effect of nice values in 
	kernel 2.6.23 and later.
        Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-nice-design.txt to SEE ALSO list.

stat.2
    mtk
        Minor wording change.

utime.2
    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls
	always change *both* timestamps).

futimes.3
    mtk
        Add documentation of lutimes(), which appeared in glibc 2.6.
    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls
	always change *both* timestamps).
        futimes() did not come from 4.2BSD.  (It came from FreeBSD; see
	the FreeBSD man page.) 
getenv.3
    mtk
        Noted that caller must not modify returned value string.
	Noted that getenv() is not reentrant: the buffer may be statically
	allocated and overwritten by later calls to getenv(), putenv(),
	setenv(), or unsettenv().
	Other minor rewrites.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        Add 'h_errno' to NAME list.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Add 'optarg', 'optind', 'opterr', and 'optopt' to NAME section.

mq_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
	Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
	needed for 'mode' constants.

rand.3
    Tolga Dalman / aeb / mtk
        Remove outdated warning in NOTES; encourage the use of
	random(3) instead.

random.3
    aeb / mtk / Tolga Dalman
        Recommend use or random_r(3) for multithreaded applications
	that need independent, reproducible sequences of random numbers.

	Move references to "The Art of Computer Programming" and
	"Numerical Recipes", formerly in rand(3), to this page.

        Add drand48(93) to SEE ALSO list.

sem_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
	Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
	needed for 'mode' constants.

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3
sem_open.3
sem_post.3
sem_unlink.3
sem_wait.3
    mtk, after a note from Marty Leisner
        Add text to SYNOPSIS noting the need to link with "-lrt" or
	"-pthread".

setenv.3
    mtk
        setenv() copies 'name' and 'value' (contrat with putenv()).
	unsetenv() of a nonexistent variable does nothing and is
	considered successful.
        Noted that setenv() and unsetenv() need not be reentrant.

shm_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
	Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
	needed for 'mode' constants.

undocumented.3
    mtk
        initstate_r(3), setkey_r(3), setstate_r(3) are now documented.
