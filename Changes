Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

numa.7
    mtk
        A new page giving overview details for the Linux NUMA interfaces.
	Incorporates some material from mbind.2, and the description
	of /proc/PID/numa_maps from proc.5.



Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------


New and changed links
---------------------

numa_maps.5
    mtk
        Link to new numa(7) page, which incorporates the
	/proc/PID/numa_maps description.
        As part of the numactl() package, the /proc/PID/numa_maps
        documentation was in a numa_maps.5 page; this link
        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (Eventually, we may want to remove this link.)
