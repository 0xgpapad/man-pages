New links
---------

timerfd_gettime.2

    mtk
        Links to eventfd.2.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    aeb
        Remove code relating to man1/README, which no longer exists.

execve.2
    mtk
        Clarify detail of RLIMIT_STACK/4 limit for argv+environ.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.

getrusage.2
    mtk
        Minor rewordings.

open.2
    Michael Haardt
        Move discussion of 'mode' argument under description of O_CREAT.

signalfd.2
    mtk
        Fix type for 'ssi_ptr' field.
        See http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/2008-01/msg00002.html.

syscalls.2
    mtk
        Add timerfd_create(), timerfd_settime(), and timerfd_gettime()
        to list.

syslog.2
    Jeremy Kerr
        Add info on command type 10.
        Add details on types 6, 7, 8, and 9.
        Minor grammar fix.
    mtk
        Update LOG_BUF_LEN details.

        Other minor edits.

ctime.3
    Walter Harms
        Note that POSIX requires localtime() to act as though tzset()
        was called, but localtime_r() does not have the same requirement.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/2034/

getaddrinfo.3
    mtk
        Clarify discussion of NULL 'hints' argument; other minor rewrites.
    mtk / Sam Varshavchik
        Remove some duplicated text.

malloc.3
    Lasse Kärkkäinen / Mike Frysinger / mtk
        Clarify description of realloc() behavior for
        ((size == 0) && (ptr != NULL)).

posix_fallocate.3
    Samuel Thibault
        s/stdlib.h/fcntl.h/ in SYNOPSIS.

proc.5
    Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
        It used to be true that the command line arguments were
        not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
        In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
        kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
        which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
        Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
        they should not have that limitation.

epoll.7
    Davide Libenzi / mtk
        Clarify the somewhat unintuitive behavior that occurs if a file
        descriptor in an epoll set is closed while other file descriptors
        referring to the same underlying open file description remain
        open.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/596462/.
    mtk
        Clarify error that occurs if we add an epoll fd to its own set.
    mtk
        A few minor rewordings.
    mtk, after a note by Chris Heath
        Rework Q1/A1, describing what happens when adding the same
        file descriptor twice to an epoll set, and when adding duplicate
        file descriptors to the same epoll set.
    Heikki Orsila / mtk / Davide Libenzi
        Clarify Q9/A9 to discuss packet/token-oriented files.
    mtk, after comments by Devide Libenzi and Chris Heath
        Added Q0/A0, making explicit that the key for items in an epoll
        set is [file descriptor, open file description].
    mtk, after a note by Ron Burk
        Change A3, to note that when events are available,
        the epoll file descriptor will indicate as being readable.
    mtk
        Add some further explanation to Q5/A5 about why an epoll file
        descriptor cannot be passed across a Unix domain socket.

posixoptions.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for standards(7).

regex.7
    mtk
        Add grep(1) to SEE ALSO.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=348552.

standards.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for posixoptions(7).
