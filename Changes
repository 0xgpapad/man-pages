        Global fix:  /non-superuser/unprivileged user/

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/non-/non/
            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is towards removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "non-" etc.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/re-/re/
            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is towards removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "re-" etc.

            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is towards removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "multi-" etc.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/pre-/pre/
            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is towards removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "pre-" etc.

time.7
    Michael Witten
        Global fix: Consistently define the Epoch
            All definitions of the Epoch have been refactored to the following:

              1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)

            That form is more consistent, logical, precise, and internationally
            recognizable than the other variants.

            Also, some wording has been altered as well.

        Update feature test macro requirements
            Starting in glibc 2.10, defining _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700,
            or _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809 exposes the declarations of
            these functions.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update text on nonsetabble CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID clocks
            SUSv3 permits, but does not require CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID to be settable.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11972.

execve.2
    Colin Watson
        Fix description of treatment of caught signals
            Caught signals reset to their default on an execve() (not
            to being ignored).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/F_OWNER_GID/F_OWNER_PGRP/
            Peter Zijlstra took the name change I suggested.

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document F_[SG]ETOWN_EX; update details on F_SETOWN
            Linux 2.6.32 adds F_SETOWN_EX and F_GETOWN_EX.
            Linux 2.6.12 changed (broke) the former behavior of
            F_SETOWN with respect to threads.

intro.2, intro.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make subsection heading consistent with other intro.? pages
            These pages used "Copyright Terms"; the other intro.? pages
            used "Copyright Conditions". Make these pages like the others.

sendfile.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify behavior when offset is NULL

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note unstandardized behavior for effective ID
            POSIX.1 doesn't require that the effective ID can be changed
            to the same value it currently has (a no-op). The man page
            should note this, since some other implementations
            don't permit it.

setgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix EPERM error description
            s/effective group ID/real group ID/
            This bug lived in man pages for 15 years before Jason
            spotted it! I checked back in Linux 1.0, and the behavior
            was as the fixed man page describes.

setreuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on POSIX.1 specification for these syscalls

setuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty statement that seteuid() is not in POSIX
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569812

stime.2, strftime.3, tzset.3, zic.8
    Michael Witten
        GMT -> UTC (where appropriate)

sync_file_range.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Add some big warnings re data integrity
            This system call is by design completely unsuitable for any data
            integrity operations.  Make that very clear in the manpage.

CPU_SET.3
    Vlastimil Babka
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types for CPU_COUNT_*()
            These functions return 'int' not void'.

confstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of 'nochdir' argument.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macro requirements for herror() and hstrerror()
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
            or _GNU_SOURCE is required.

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect that these functions were standardized in POSIX.1-2008

getnameinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macros requirements for NI_MAXHOST and NI_MAXSERV
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, or _GNU_SOURCE
            must be defined to obtain these definitions.

getopt.3
    Jonathan Nieder
        Fix feature test macro requirements

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature text macro requirements for memrchr()

nextafter.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix notable error in DESCRIPTION.
        "less than y" should be "less than x".

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3, pthread_attr_setschedparam.3, pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
    Denis Barbier
        Argument name is 'attr' not 'thread'
            The function argument was misnamed in the DESCRIPTION on these
            three pages.

rtnetlink.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in example code
            Edward reported a problem in the example code, where a variable
            seems to be misnamed. Upon inspection, there seem to be a few
            such instances, and this patch is my best guess at how things
            should look.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place correct header file in SYNOPSIS

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        sleep() puts calling *thread* to sleep (not calling *process*)

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        Add nanosleep(2) to SEE ALSO

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        %z is defined in SUSv3
        So, substitute "GNU" tag in man page by "SU".

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Move 822-compliant date format example to EXAMPLES section
            The RFC 822-compliant date format given in the description
            of `%z' is now moved to the `EXAMPLES' section (note: `EXAMPLE'
            has been renamed `EXAMPLES').

            Furthermore, that format example is now actually
            RFC 822-compliant (using `%y' instead of `%Y') and has been
            qualified as being correct only when in the context of at least
            an English locale. Also, `%T' is used in place of `%H:%M:%S'.

            For completeness, an RFC 2822-compliant format example has been
            similarly added.

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Expand introductory text

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Clarification of %z specifier

string.3
    Mark Hills
        Add stpcpy() to this list of string functions

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Initialize tm structure in example program

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove pages now documented
            By now, the following are documented:

                fopencookie(3)
                freeifaddrs(3)
                rawmemchr(3)
                readdir_r(3)
                getutmp(3)
                getutmpx(3)
                utmpxname(3)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

group.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/passwd/password/
            The page inconsistently used "passwd" and "password"
            to refer to the same field.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update securebits discussion to use SECBIT_* flags

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE
            Since glibc 2.10, _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add readlink(2) to SEE ALSO

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix NAME line
            The poorly constructed part receding "\-" causes apropos
            not to be able to find the subject.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=558300

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of SIGUNUSED
            Clarify that this signal really is synonymous with SIGSYS.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14449
