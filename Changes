        Added SEE ALSO reference to syscalls.2.


New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
	(This page replaces a previous link of the same, which linked
	signal.2.)

spu_create.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_create() system call.
	(Originally taken from the kernel source file
	Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

spu_run.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_run() system call.
	(Originally taken from the kernel source file
	Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

spufs.7
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU file system.
	(Originally taken from the kernel source file
	Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)


Removed Pages
-------------

__clone.2
    mtk
        This file was created by accident in 2.61, as a copy of clone.2.
	(it should have been a link to clone.2.)

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
	respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
	to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
	is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other 
	places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
	is a killpg.2.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Fairly substantial rewrites of various parts,
	and a few additions.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) needs
       	either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".

chown.2
    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) and lchown(2)
        need either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".
	Added an example program.

killpg.2
    mtk
        Note that killpg() is actually a library function on Linux.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Added note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays invokes mmap2().

mmap2.2
    Ivana Varekova / mtk
        On most platforms the unit for 'offset' is 4096 bytes, not
	the system page size.
    mtk
        Rewrote NOTES to note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays
	invokes this system call.
    mtk
        Added an EXAMPLE program.

oldfstat.2
oldlstat.2
oldstat.2
    mtk
        Changed link to point to stat.2 (instead of obsolete.2).

    Martin Röhricht
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to SYNOPSIS.

shmctl.2
    mtk
        Add svipc(7) to SEE ALSO list.

        Added info on rt_sigqueueinfo(2).

sigwaitinfo.2
    mtk
        Noted that sigwaitinfo() is a library function implemented on
        top of sigtimedwait().

    mtk
        Make this link point to new sgetmask.2 instead of signal.2.

stat.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
	have appeared over time.

uname.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
	have appeared over time.

            by Justin Pryzby

	See Debian bug 417933.

        IN_DONT_FOLLOW and IN_ONLYDIR are only available from 2.6.15.
