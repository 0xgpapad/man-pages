Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Removed version numbers in .TH lines.
        Reason: these were only arbitrarily updated, and so impart no 
        useful information.  Version information goes into a 
        VERSIONS section nowadays, and the date in the .TH line should
        be updated to reflect the date of the last (significant)
        change to the page.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.
