Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
pipe.2
tee.2
fmemopen.3
mq_notify.3
qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace use of assert() by code that checks argc
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13569

            As noted by Andrey:
            The purpose of the assert macro, defined in <assert.h>,
            is to provide a tool to check for programming mistakes
            or program logic errors. However, the assert macro must
            never be used to perform checks for run time errors,
            since, with the NDEBUG macro defined, expressions within
            the assert macro invocations are not evaluated/checked
            for, resulting in behavior that was not originally intended.
            ...
            The pages affected in the core package are

            execve(2)
            pipe(2)
            tee(2)
            fmemopen(3)
            mq_notify(3)
            qsort(3)

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ru_inblock and ru_oublock are now implemented
            These fields of the rusage structure are filled in since
            Linux 2.6.22.

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add brief documentation of MAP_HUGETLB
            This flag is new in 2.6.32, and serves a similar
            purpose to the shmget() SHM_HUGETLB flag.

open.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        add some comments on O_SYNC and friends

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording describing of 'nfds' argument.
            reported by: rui rlex <rui.rlex@gmail.com>

semctl.2
    Nicolas François
        Remove some redundant words

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an explanation of orphaned process groups

splice.2
tee.2
vmsplice.2
    Mark Hills
        Fix return type
            Since glibc 2.7, the return type for these functions
            is ssize_t (formerly it was long).

stat.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix small bug in example program
            Since it is a failure, EXIT_FAILURE looks more appropriate
            than EXIT_SUCCESS.

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc only exposes MNT_DETACH and MNT_EXPIRE since version 2.11
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10092

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a pointer to explanation of orphaned process groups in setpgid(2)

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        fflush() discards buffered input

ffs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that ffsl() and ffsll() are GNU extensions

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note nonstandard assumed hints.ai_flags value when hints is NULL
            When hints is NULL, glibc assumes hints.ai_flags is
            AI_V4MAPPED|AI_ADDRCONFIG whereas POSIX says 0.
            According to Ulrich Drepper, glibc's behavior is better.

getmntent.3
    Mike Frysinger
        setmntent() argument is 'filename' not 'fp'
            The description of setmntent() formerly used the wrong
            argument name.

posix_fallocate.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix reference to POSIX.1-2008
            The sentence mentions twice POSIX.1-2001.
            I guess the second one should be POSIX.1-2008.
            This should be checked in the standard.

setenv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve ERRORS section
            Add ENOMEM error; improve EINVAL description. Also, make
            RETURN VALUE section a little more accurate in its mention
            of errno.

strftime.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix error in description: s/Monday/Thursday/

proc.5
    Nicolas François
        Fix page cross reference
            max_user_watches is better explained in epoll(7) than inotify(7).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        dmesg is in section 1, not section 8

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        FS UID manipulations affect CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE and CAP_MKNOD
            Nowadays, file system UID manipulations also affect
            CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since 2.6.3) and CAP_MKNOD (since 2.6.29).

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CAP_MKNOD in DS UID manipulations
            A recent patch said "since 2.6.29". It should have
            been "since 2.6.30".

capabilities.7
    Nicolas François
        Reword a bad sentence in description of capability bounding set.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change documented ranges for msg_max and msgsize_max
            Linux 2.6.28 changed the permissible ranges for
            these /proc files.

tcp.7
udp.7
    Nicolas François
        Replace references to syctl interfaces with /proc
