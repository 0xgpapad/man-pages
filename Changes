Page renamings
--------------

The following pages have been relocated into section 7, since
that is their more natural home.  SEE ALSO references in various
other pages have been adjusted.

epoll.4
fifo.4
futex.4
complex.5
environ.5  (many pages outside man-pages actually *expect*
           'environ' to be in Section 7.)
ipc.5 renamed to svipc.7

".so" link files have been created to link the old file locations to the 
new file locations.  These links are added just to ensure that cross 
references from any other (non-man-pages) pages will remain valid;
eventually these links will be removed.
