Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mlock.2
    mtk
        Reworded text around PAGESIZE, noting also that 
        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
   mtk / aeb
       Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
       "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
       since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
       the effective UID is not.

       Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of 
       it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file 
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file 
        system GID.

shmget.2
    mtk
        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers
        Noted that ss_sp is automatically aligned by the kernel.

byteorder.3
    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert@gondor.apana.org.au
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text 
            explaining that some systems need the former header.
            As per Debian bug 265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.
