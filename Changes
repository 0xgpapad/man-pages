==================== Changes in man-pages-2.59 ====================

Released: 2007-??-??

Global changes
--------------

Manual pages are now standardized on American spelling.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences
for more information on the differences.  Formerly, different pages (and
sometimes even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions; best to stnadarize on one spelling, and American English
is the standard in Computer Science.
