Global changes
--------------


     Various pages use inconsistent terms for 'null byte' (which
     is the C99/SUSv3 term for the '\0' character).

     To rectify this the following changes were made in the above pages:
    
         Replace 'zero byte' with 'null byte'.
         Replace 'null character' with 'null byte'.
         Replace 'nulls' with 'null bytes'.
	 Replace 'NUL-terminated' by 'null-terminated'.
	 Replace 'NUL' by 'null byte'.
	 Replace 'terminating NUL' by 'terminating null byte'.
	 Replace 'final NUL' by 'terminating null byte'.
	 Replace 'NUL character' by 'null byte'.
     
Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.
