Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.

Various pages
    mtk
        Order errors under ERRORS alphabetically.

Various pages
    Nicolas François
        Spelling and formatting fixes, as per Debian bug 439560.


New pages
---------

timeradd.3
    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.


New links
---------

clock_getres.2
clock_gettime.2
clock_settime.2
    mtk
        Link to man3/clock_getres.3.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Link to fsync.2.

    mtk
        Link to opendir.3.

gethostbyaddr_r.3
    Mats Wichmann
        Link to gethostbyaddr.3.

timerclear.3
timercmp.3
timerisset.3
timersub.3
    mtk
       Links to new timeradd.3.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    Mike Frysinger
        Make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "DESTDIR" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        Replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        removed cautionary note that use of MPOL_F_NODE|MPOL_F_ADDR
        is not supported.  This is no longer true.

        added mmap(2) to See Also list.

ioctl_list.2
    Nicolas George
        Fixed argument type for BLKGETSIZE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.
        
        rewrite portions of description for clarification.
        
            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including SHM_HUGE regions.
        
            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.
        
            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.
        
            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.
        
        added mmap(2), shmget(2), shmat(2) to See Also list.

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

    Maxime Vaudequin
        Fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
	/proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only FS compiled
          into the kernel, also FS kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for FS marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "SEE ALSO"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
	  think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no FS
	  is specified. So, usage of "may" which IMHO is more
	  appropriate + additional explanations
          In mount(8) we can see:

               If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
	       specified, mount will try to guess the desired type. 
	       If mount was compiled with the blkid library, the 
	       guessing is done by this library. Otherwise, mount 
	       guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that 
	       does not turn up anything that looks familiar, 
	       mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
	       or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
	       All of the filesystem types listed there will be 
	       tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev" 
	       (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If /etc/filesystems 
	       ends in a line with a single * only, mount will 
	       read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    Samuel Thibault
        Since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
	lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
	systems when running in a virtualized environment.

arp.7
        Updated BUGS text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.

credentials.7
    mtk
        Add words to note that file system ID is Linux specific.

hier.7
    Maxime Vaudequin
        This is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary FS
	  mount point, as it is specified by FHS:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#
                      MNTMOUNTPOINTFORATEMPORARILYMOUNT
        - s/X-Windows/X-Window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "SEE ALSO": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/ 

man-pages.7
man.7
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Nowadays tmac.XXX are called XXX.tmac.

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update text about modern threading implementations
        (NPTL vs LinuxThreads).

socket.7
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen
        Clarify that SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO only have effect for
	socket I/O calls; not for multiplexing system calls like
	select() and poll().

time.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO reference to new timeradd.3.
