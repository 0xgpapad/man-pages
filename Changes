New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getent.1
    Mark R. Bannister
        New page to document 'getent' binary provided by glibc


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that bdflush() is deprecated, and does nothing

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that this system call was removed in Linux 3.1

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Tejun Heo]
        add extended description of various ptrace quirks
            Changes include:

            s/parent/tracer/g, s/child/tracee/g - ptrace interface now
            is sufficiently cleaned up to not treat tracing process
            as parent.

            Deleted several outright false statements:
            - pid 1 can be traced
            - tracer is not shown as parent in ps output
            - PTRACE_ATTACH is not "the same behavior as if tracee had done
              a PTRACE_TRACEME": PTRACE_ATTACH delivers a SIGSTOP.
            - SIGSTOP _can_ be injected.
            - Removed mentions of SunOS and Solaris as irrelevant.
            - Added a few more known bugs.

            Added a large block of text in DESCRIPTION which doesn't focus
            on mechanical description of each flag and operation, but rather
            tries to describe a bigger picture. The targeted audience is
            a person which is reasonably knowledgeable in Unix but did not
            spend years working with ptrace, and thus may be unaware of its
            quirks. This text went through several iterations of review by
            Oleg Nesterov and Tejun Heo.
            This block of text intentionally uses as little markup as possible,
            otherwise future modifications to it will be very hard to make.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global clean-up of page
            * Wording and formatting fixes to existing text and
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Various technical amendments and improvements to
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Added FIXME for various problems with the current text.
