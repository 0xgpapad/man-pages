Removed pages (!)
-----------------

Most Section 1 man pages are removed
    mtk (with help from Mike Frysinger, Laird Shaw, Andreas Halter)
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the 
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.  The following pages disappear:
        
            chgrp.1
            chmod.1
            chown.1
            cp.1
            dd.1
            df.1
            diff.1
            dir.1
            dircolors.1
            du.1
            install.1
            ln.1
            ls.1
            mkdir.1
            mkfifo.1
            mknod.1
            mv.1
            rm.1
            rmdir.1
            touch.1
            vdir.1

        The following Section 1 pages will be kept:

            intro.1
            ldd.1
            time.1
