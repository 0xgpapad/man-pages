==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with 
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to 
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by 
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be 
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts: 
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and 
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts 
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without 
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections 
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7 
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh 
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).
