New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

acct.5
    mtk
        A complete rewrite of this page, now with much more detail.

hostname.7
    mtk
        A description og hostnames.    
        Taken from FreeBSD 6.2, and lightly edited for man-pages style.

symlink.7
    mtk
        Taken from FreeBSD 6.2, but heavily edited for Linux details,
	improved readability, and man-pages style.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Peter Zijlstra
        Add description of RLIMIT_RTTIME limit, new in 2.6.25.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Add description of mkostemp(), new in glibc 2.7.

core.5
    mtk, after a note by Petr Gajdos; review by Neil Horman
        Document core_pattern pipe syntax, which appeared in
	kernel 2.6.19.
	Add an example program demonstrating use of core_pattern
	pipe syntax.
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/coredump_filter, new in kernel 2.6.23.
	Documentation was based on the text in
	Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt, plus testing, and
	reading the kernel source.

proc.5
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/oom_score, which was new in kernel 2.6.11.
	This file displays the "badness" score of the process, which 
	provides the basis for OOM-killer decisions.
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/oom_adj, which was new in kernel 2.6.11.
	This file influences the oom_score of a process.
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/limits, which was new in 2.6.24.
	This file displays a process's resource limits.
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/fdinfo/*, which was new in 2.6.22.
        These files display info about each descriptor opened by the
	process: the current file offset, and the file access mode +
	file status flags as set in open() or fcntl(F_SETFL).
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/mountinfo, which was new in 2.6.26.
	This file displays information about mount points.
	Closely based on text from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.
    mtk
        Document /proc/PID/mountstats, which was new in 2.6.17.
	This file displays statistics about mount points.


New links
---------

mkostemp.3
    mtk
        Link to mkstemp.3.

getcwd.2
    mtk
        Link to getcwd.3, which describes several interfaces, among
	them getcwd(), which is in fact a system call.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

acct.2
    mtk
        Add a few more words to DESCRIPTION.
	NOTES: Add pointer to acct(5).

alarm.2
    Alain Portal
        s/process/calling process/ so as to that the alarm signal is
	delivered to the calling process.

brk.2
    Yao Zhao / mtk
        Clarify discussion of return value of sbrk().
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add some sentences giving an overview of these
	interfaces.
        Add note recommending use of malloc(3).
	Change name of brk() argument to the simpler 'addr'.
	Add "(void *)" cast to "-1" for error return of sbrk().
	Removed some incorrect text about "brk(0)".
	Note that SUSv2 specified the return value of sbrk().
	Added a detail on the glibc brk() wrapper.
	Remove discussions of standards old (C89 and POSIX.1-1990);
	CONFORMING TO already discusses the situation with respect
	to more recent standards.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Clarify description of chmod() and fchmod().
	Add further detail on S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX permissions.
	Reformat list of permissions bits.

chown.2
    mtk
        Describe rules governing ownership of new files (bsdgroups
	versus sysvgroups, and the effect of the parent directory's
	set-group-ID permission bit).

chroot.2
    Alain Portal
        Clarify description a little.
	s/changes the root directory/
	  changes the root directory of the calling process/

execve.2
    mtk
        Fix text that warns against use of NULL argv and envp.
	Using a NULL envp does in fact seem to be portable (works
        on Solaris and FreeBSD), but the Linux semantics for a NULL
	argv certainly aren't consistent with other implementations.
	See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408.

mknod.2
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
	(possibly dangling) symbolic link.

open.2
    mtk, after a note from Christoph Hellwig
        NOTES: Note that access mode flags are not single bits,
	and document the Linuxism "access mode 3".
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/653123.

sched_setscheduler.2
    mtk
        Add pointer to discussion of RLIMIT_RTTIME in getrlimit.2.
    mtk, after a note by Andrew Clayton
        Rewrote and restructured various parts of the page for greater
	clarity.

dprintf.3
    mtk
        Note that these functions are included in the next POSIX revision.
	Remove editorial discussion about what the functions should have
	been named.

getaddrinfo.3
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add hostname(7).

getmntent.3
    mtk, after Stuart Cunningham pointed out the typo
        Remove statement that LSB deprecates the functions
	"endmntent(), setmntent() [sic] and setmntent()".
	This doesn't seem to be true (I can't find mention of
	deprecation in any of the LSB specs).  Rather, LSB simply
	doesn't specify these functions.  (LSB 1.3 had a spec of
	setmntent(), but not getmntent() or endmntent(), and noted
	that having a spec of setmntent() was of little use without
	also having a spec of getmntent().)
	See also https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/\
	lsb-discuss/2006-October/003078.html

getnameinfo.3
    mtk
        Various minor changes.

mkfifo.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
	(possibly dangling) symbolic link.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
	Fix discussion of O_EXCL flag.
        These functions may also fail for any of the errors described
	in open(2).
	Various other rewordings.

remainder.3
    mtk
        Recommend against drem(), in favor of remainder().

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Enhanced description of VERSIONS section.
        
mq_overview.7
   mtk
        Note that Linux does not currently support ACLs for POSIX
	message queues.

sem_overview.7
    mtk
        Note that Linux supports ACLs on POSIX named semaphores
	since 2.6.19.

unix.7
    mtk, after a note by Samuel Thibault
        Provide a clear description of the three types of address that
	can appear in the sockaddr_un structure: pathname, unnamed,
	and abstract.
