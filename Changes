==================== Changes in man-pages-2.70 ====================

Released: 2007-12-06


Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Remove section numbers for page references where the
        reference refers to the page itself.  (This stops man2html

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several places.
