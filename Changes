New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

udplite.7
    Gerrit Renker
	Document the Linux implementation of the UDP-Lite protocol,
	new in Linux 2.6.20.


New and changed links
---------------------


Global changes
--------------

nanosleep.2
inet_ntop.3
inet_pton.3
scanf.3
initrd.4
    mtk
        Fix mis-ordered (.SH) sections.

connect.2
socket.2
rtnetlink.3
arp.7
ddp.7
ip.7
ipv6.7
netlink.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
unix.7
x25.7
    mtk
        s/PF_/AF_/ for socket family constants.  Reasons: the AF_ and
	PF_ constants have always had the same values; there never has
	been a protocol family that had more than one address family,
	and POSIX.1-2001 only specifies the AF_* constants.


Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    mtk
        The floating-point environment is reset to the default
	during an execve().

getitimer.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and setitimer()
    	obsolete.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Misc cleanup of get_mempolicy(2):
	+ mention that any mode flags will be saved with mode.
	  I don't bother to document mode flags here because we
	  already have a pointer to set_mempolicy(2) for more info
	  on memory policy.  mode flags are discussed there.
	+ remove some old, obsolete [IMO] NOTES and 'roff comments.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Update the get_mempolicy(2) man page to add in the description of
        the MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED flag, added in 2.6.23.
    mtk
        Document additional EINVAL error that occurs is MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED
        is specified with either MPOL_F_ADDR or MPOL_F_NODE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix error conditions, now that the kernel silently ignores
	nodes outside the task's cpuset, as long as one valid node
	remains.

	Now that cpuset man page exists, we can refer to it.  Remove
	stale comment regarding lack thereof.

mprotect.2
    mtk / Maxin John
        Remove EFAULT from errors.  Under ENOMEM error, note that
	EFAULT was the error produced in some cases for kernels before
	2.4.19.
     
msgctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
	incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix up the error return for nodemask containing nodes disallowed by
	the process' current cpuset.  Disallowed nodes are now silently ignored,
	as long as the nodemask contains at least one node that is on-line,
	allowed by the process' cpuset and has memory.

	Now that we have a cpuset man page, we can refer to cpusets directly
	in the man page text. 
    Lee Schermerhorn
	Add discussion of mempolicy mode flags to set_mempolicy(2).
	This adds another reason for EINVAL.

setpgid.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks setpgrp() obsolete.

semctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
	incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

shmctl.2
    Filippo Santovito / mtk
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
	incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

utime.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks utime() obsolete.
	CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the POSIX.1-2001 LEGACY
	marking of utimes(), so mention of this point has been
	removed from the page.

        Add EINVAL ENAMETOOLONG errors for getwd().
	Various other clarifications and wording fixes.
