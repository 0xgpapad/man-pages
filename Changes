Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    aeb
        Remove code relating to man1/README, which no longer exists.

getitimer.2
    mtk
       Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.

syslog.2
    Jeremy Kerr
        Add info on command type 10.
	Add details on types 6, 7, 8, and 9.

    mtk
        Update LOG_BUF_LEN details.
        Update RETURN VALUE section.

ctime.3
    Walter Harms
        Note that POSIX requires localtime() to act as though tzset()
        was called, but localtime_r() does not have the same requirement.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/2034/

proc.5
    Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
	It used to be true that the command line arguments were
	not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
	In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
	kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
	which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
	Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
	they should not have that limitation.

time.7
    mtk
       Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.
