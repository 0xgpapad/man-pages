    The wording describing how errno is set was tidied up in the
    following pages:

            accept.2
            close.2
            send.2
            setsid.2
            socket.2
            closedir.3
            initgroups.3
            mkstemp.3
            opendir.3
            readdir.3

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443
        
strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538
                
strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..60.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says 
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 -- 
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed this the 
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg / http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon 
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros <sytdlib.h> 
        as for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behaviour
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.
