Global changes
--------------

The goal of the changes below to consistently format copyright
and license information in the comments in the page source
at the top of each page. This allows for easy scripting to
extract that information. Following these changes the comments
the top of the page source should now consistently have the form:

    .\" <copyright info, possibly spread over several lines>
    .\"
    .\" %%%LICENSE_START(<license-type>)
    .\" <license text>
    .\" %%%LICENSE_END
    .\" <other comments>

Note that the 'license-type' is merely descriptive.  Its purpose is
to simplify scripting for the purpose of gathering statistics on
types of licenses used in man-pages.  It is NOT a statement about
the actual licensing of the page; that license is contain INSIDE the
LICENSE_START...LICENSE_END clause.


All pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a LICENSE_START()...LICENSE_END clause in source at
        top of each page that encapsulates the license text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put copyright info at top of page, followed by blank line and LICENSE

Various pages
