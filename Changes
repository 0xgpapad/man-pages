Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPIS about linking 
        or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
        marked up in italacs (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

Various pages
    mtk
        Added page numbers to page cross references.

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


New pages
---------

man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed 
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.

Removed pages
-------------

man1/README
    mtk
        Already deleted most of the man1 pages previously, so
        this doesn't need to stay.
LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place 
        to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/.

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
        (Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
        I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
        old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Moved some material out of here into new man-pages.7.

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
        some outdated text.

epoll_pwait.2
    Michael Berg
        Fix broken link path; Debian bug 425570.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling 
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being 
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note 
        about this historical behaviour.

mremap.2
    mtk
        Remove text about the non-existent BSD meremap() -- too
        much information, in my opinion.

sched_yield.2
    mtk
        Added ERROS section.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

set_tid_address.2
    mtk
        Small rewording in RETURN VALUE section.

sync_file_range.2
    mtk
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS.  Add RETURN VALUE section.

atexit.3
    mtk
        Small rearrangement of text under NOTES.

bindresvport.3
    mtk
        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
        FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.
        Added feenableexcept, fedisableexcept, fegetexcept
        to .SH NAME list.

fputwc.3
    mtk
        Added 'putwc' to .SH NAME list.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
        text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
        since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

unlocked_stdio.3
    mtk
        Revised .SH NAME section.

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

capability.7
    mtk
        s/exec()/execve(2)/ in various places.

complex.7
    mtk
        Changed "atan(1)" to "atan(1.0)" to prevent some versions of
        man2html(1) from mistaking that string as a page cross reference.

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Small restructuring to avoid 'cannot adjust line' from man(1).

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
        libraries with -lc.

man.7
    mtk
        Various text was moved out of this page into the new man-pages.7.

mdoc.7
    mtk
         Added SEE ALSO referring to new man-pages.7.

mdoc.samples.7
    mtk
         A few changes, hopefully done right, to eliminate some
         errors to stderr when rendering with man(1).

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Shorten a line in table so it fits in 80 columns.
        Minor rewording under BUGS.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.
