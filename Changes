New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getcpu.2
    Andi Kleen, with some text and edits by mtk
        Documents the getcpu(2) system call, introduced in Linux 2.6.19.

sched_getcpu.3
    mtk
        Documents sched_getcpu(3), a wrapper for getcpu(2), provided
	since glibc 2.6.

cpuset.7
    Paul Jackson, with review and editing by mtk, and comments by
    Hidetoshi Seto and Li Zefan
        A description of the cpuset file system, the mechanism introduced
        kernel 2.6.12 for confining processes to designated processors
        and nodes.  (Becomes the fourth largest page in man-pages!)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------



New links

updwtmpx.3
    Alain Portal
        Link to updwtmp.3 (3.02 changelog wrongly said this had been done).



Global changes
--------------



Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    mtk
        Small wording fix.

get_mempolicy.2
mbind.2
sched_setaffinity.2
set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
	SEE ALSO: Add getcpu(2).

io_getevents.2
    mtk
        ERRORS: Add EINTR error.

open.2
    mtk
        ERRORS: Add EINTR error.

sigaction.2
    mtk
        Note circumstances in which each SA_* flag is meaningful.
	handler for SIGCHLD.
    mtk
	Describe POSIX specification, and Linux semantics for
	SA_NOCLDWAIT when establishing a handler for SIGCHLD.
    mtk
        Add pointer under SA_RESTART to new text in signal(7)
    	describing system call restarting.
    mtk
        Other minor edits.

wait.2
    mtk
        Remove statement that WUNTRACED and WCONTINUED only have effect
	if SA_NOCLDSTOP has not been set for SIGCHLD.  That's not true.

errno.3
    mtk
        Add a pointer to signal(7) for further explanation of EINTR.

getgrouplist.3
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add passwd(5).

group.5
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add getgrent(3), getgrnam(3).

        SEE ALSO: Add getpwent(3), getpwnam(3).

proc.5
    mtk
        Add pointer to description of /proc/PID/cpuset in cpuset(7).

signal.7
    mtk
        Add a section describing system call restarting, and noting
	which system calls are affected by SA_RESTART, and which
	system calls are never restarted.
    mtk
        Describe the aberrant Linux behavior whereby a stop signal
	plus SIGCONT can interrupt some system calls, even if no
	signal handler has been established, and note the system
	calls that behave this way.
    mtk
        Note a few more architectures on which signal numbers are valid.
	SEE ALSO: added a number of pages.
