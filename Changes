Global changes
--------------

Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in 
man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has 
been removed where it occurred.

Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.
