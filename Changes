Global changes
--------------

This release consists mainly of changes to source file layout
(wrapped long lines; stripped trailing white space; started new
sentences on new lines).

There is very little change to output formatting or content (see the
notes below).


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sched_rr_get_interval.2
    mtk
        Remove crufty statement that this system call is not implemented.
        The nice interval can be used to control the size of
	the round-robin quantum.
	Corrected .TH line.

ip.7
    John Heffner / mtk
        Document IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE, which will be in 2.6.22.
