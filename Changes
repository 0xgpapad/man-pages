Global changes
--------------

The following pages have been relocated into section 7, since
that is their more natural home.  SEE ALSO references in various
other pages have been adjusted.

epoll.4
fifo.4
futex.4
complex.5
environ.5  (many pages outside man-pages actually *expect*
           'environ' to be in Section 7.)
ipc.5 renamed to svipc.7

".so" link files have been created to link the old file locations to the 
new file locations.  These links are added just to ensure that cross 
references from any other (non-man-pages) pages will remain valid;
eventually these links will be removed.  

getgroups.2
wait4.2
chown.2
chdir.2
gettimeofday.2
initgroups.3
dirfd.3
    mtk
	Simplified wording around requirement for _BSD_SOURCE 
	feature test macro.

New pages
---------


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Mark Glines
	Remove mention of SOCK_RDM from this page, since this socket 
	type does not support accept()ing connections.

gettimeofday.2
    Karel Kulhavy
        Point out more explicitly that 'tz' argument should 
	normally be NULL.
    mtk
        Various other minor edits and formatting fixes.

select.2
    Karel Kulhavy
        Note more clearly that fd_set arguments can be NULL.
    mtk
        Various other minor edits and formatting fixes.
    
semget.2
    mtk / Nishanth Aravamudan
        Add text to noting that the initial values of semaphores
	in a new set is indeterminate.
    
shmget.2
    mtk / Nishanth Aravamudan
        Add text noting that contents of newly created segment are zero 
	values.
    
stat.2
    Nishanth Aravamudan / mtk
        Added NOTE that st_size is always returned as zero for most 
	/proc files.

ctanh.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze / mtk
        Fix errors in DESCRIPTION
	
fmemopen.3
    mtk / Ryan S. Arnold
        Add text noting that explicitly controlling output buffering 
        may be useful to catch errors on output operations on an 
	fmemopen() stream.

strtod.3
strtoul.3
    mtk
        Describe correct handling or errno in order to 
	distinguish error from success after the call.

	Added EXAMPLE section which points to strtol.3 which provides 
	an example of the use of the analogous strtol(3).

strtol.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
        Add an example program.
    mtk
        Describe correct handling or errno in order to 
	distinguish error from success after the call.

tmpfile.3
    Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> 
        DESCRIPTION does not need to say "temporary file name"
	just "temporary file", since the name is in any case 
	unavailable to the user.
        See Debian bug 363518
    mtk
        In DESCRIPTION:
	Change /automatically deleted when the program terminates normally/
	to     /automatically deleted when the program terminates/
	since deletion occurs on both normal and abnormal termination.

ip.7
    Karel Kulhavy / mtk
        Various wording improvements and clarifications.
