Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPIS about linking 
	or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
	marked up in itlacs (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Removed pages
-------------

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place 
	to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/.

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
	(Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
	I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
	old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
	some outdated text.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling 
	open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being 
	equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note 
	about this historical behaviour.

mremap.2
    mtk
        Remove text about the non-existent BSD meremap() -- too
	much information, in my opinion.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

atexit.3
    mtk
        Small rearrangement of text under NOTES.

bindresvport.3
    mtk
        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
	FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
	text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
	since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
	libraries with -lc.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.
