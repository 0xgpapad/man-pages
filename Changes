==================== Changes in man-pages-2.46 ====================

Released: 2007-04-06

Global changes
--------------

This release consists mainly of formatting fixes (to a large 
number of pages) to achieve greater consistency across pages:

* Most instances of two or more consecutive blank lines in man 
  page output were shrunk to a single line.
* A number of example programs were reformatted
  to more closely match K&R style.
* In various places (mainly code examples), the use of tabs was 
  replaced by spaces

With the exception of the few individual changes noted below, 
no changes were made to content.
