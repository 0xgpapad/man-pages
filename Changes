Global changes

Various pages
    Kir Kolyshkin
        Trivial punctuation fixes in SEE ALSO
            In SEE ALSO, when a few man pages are referenced, those
            are divided by commas.  Every reference is on a separate
            line, and all lines but the last one should end with
            comma. I spotted one place where there is no comma in
            between references, and mocked up an awk script to find
            similar places:

            for f in man*/*; do
                awk '
                    /^.SH ["]SEE ALSO["]/ {
                        sa=1; print "== " FILENAME " =="; print; next
                    }
                    /^\.(PP|SH)/ {
                        sa=0; no=0; next
                    }
                    /^\.BR/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print;
                            if (no == 1)
                                print "Missing comma in " FILENAME " +" FNR-1; no=0
                        }
                    }
                    /^\.BR .*)$/ {
                        if (sa==1)
                            no=1;
                        next
                    }
                    /\.\\"/ {next}
                    /.*/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print; next
                        }
                    }
                ' $f;
            done | fgrep 'Missing comma'

            This patch fixes all the places found by the above script.

            Also, there is an extra dot at the end of uri.7 "SEE ALSO"
            section.  Removed as per man-pages(7) recommendation.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getitimer.2, clock_getcpuclockid.3, time.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add timer_create(2)

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments for consistency with other timer pages
            Also some other minor wording improvements

splice.2
    Mark Hills
        ERRORS: Add EINVAL case for file opened O_APPEND
            Target file cannot be opened in append (O_APPEND) mode

            In kernels prior to v2.6.27 splice() to a file in
            append mode is broken, and since that version it is
            disallowed. It is possible this behaviour may change
            in the future; see the kernel commit message
            (efc968d450e013049a662d22727cf132618dcb2f) for more
            information.
