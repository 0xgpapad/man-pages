Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Minor changes.

bind.2
    Stefan Puiu / mtk
        Remove text under EINVAL error: "This may change in the future: 
        see linux/unix/sock.c for details."  This behaviour has been
        unchanged for a long time, and seems unlikely to change.

        Add EADDRINUSE to errors.

send.2
    aeb
        Add cmsg(3) to SEE ALSO.

fopen.3
    Walter Harms / mtk
        Added description of 'x' mode character (exclusive open).

pipe.7
    mtk / aeb
        Some wording changes to description of pipes.
