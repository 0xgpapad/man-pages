New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getnetent_r.3
    mtk
        Documents getnetent_r(), getnetbyname_r(),
	and getnetbyaddr_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
	getnetent(), getnetbyname(), and getnetbyaddr().

getprotoent_r.3
     mtk
        Documents getprotoent_r(), getprotobyname_r(), and
	getprotobynumber_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
	getprotoent(), getprotobyname(), and getprotobynumber().

getrpcent_r.3
     mtk
        Documents getrpcent_r(), getrpcbyname_r(), and
	getrpcbynumber_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
	getrpcent(), getrpcbyname(), and getrpcbynumber().

getservent_r.3
     mtk
        Documents getservent_r(), getservbyname_r(), and
	getservbyport_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
	getservent(), getservbyname(), and getservbyport().

numa.7
    mtk
        A new page giving overview details for the Linux NUMA interfaces.
	Incorporates some material from mbind.2, and the description
	of /proc/PID/numa_maps from proc.5.


New and changed links
---------------------

getnetbyname_r.3
getnetbyaddr_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getnetent_r.3.

getprotobyname_r.3
getprotobynumber_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcbyname_r.3
getrpcbynumber_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getrpcent_r.3.

getservbyname_r.3
getservbyport_r.3
    mtk
        New links to new getservent_r.3.

numa_maps.5
    mtk
        Link to new numa(7) page, which incorporates the
	/proc/PID/numa_maps description.
        As part of the numactl() package, the /proc/PID/numa_maps
        documentation was in a numa_maps.5 page; this link
        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (Eventually, we may want to remove this link.)


Global changes
--------------

get_mempolicy.2
mbind.2
move_pages.2
set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
	Add reference to numa(7) for information on library support.
	Added  a VERSIONS section.
        SEE ALSO: Add numa(7).


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

eventfd.2
    Vijay Kumar
        When an eventfd overflows, select() indicates the file as both
	readable and writable (not as having an exceptional condition).

mbind.2
    mtk
        Remove material on library support and numactl; that material
	is now in numactl.7.

move_pages.2
    mtk
        Added VERSIONS (from kernel 2.6.18) and CONFORMING TO sections.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        Clarify exactly which functions are obsoleted by getnameinfo()
        and getaddrinfo().
	
getnetent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
	Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
	the database if necessary.
	The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
	'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
	s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        In glibc 2.2, the type of the 'net' argument for getnetbyaddr()
	changed from 'long' to 'uint32_t'.
    mtk
        Note that the gethostbyaddr() 'net" argument is in host byte order.
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
	statically allocated structure.
	SEE ALSO: add getnetent_r.3.

getprotoent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
	Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
	the database if necessary.
	The database connection is held opend between get*() calls if
	'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
	s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
	statically allocated structure.
	SEE ALSO: add getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcent.3
    mtk
    	s/rpc/RPC/.
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
	Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
	the database if necessary.
	s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
	statically allocated structure.
	SEE ALSO: add getrpcent_r.3.

getservent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.

	'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
	s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
	statically allocated structure.

mq_notify.3
    Venkatesh Srinivas
        s/sigev_notify_function/sigev_thread_function/
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494956.

proc.5
    mtk
        Remove /proc/PID/numa_maps material (it is now in numa(7)).

cpuset.7
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add numa(7).
