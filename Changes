Newly documented interfaces in existing pages

Global changes

        Make wording around thread-safety and setlocale() more precise

getdate.3
strptime.3
locale.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace "weekday" with less ambiguous language
            Notwithstanding POSIX's use of the term "weekday", in everyday
            English, "weekday" is commonly understood to mean a day in the
            set [Monday..Friday] (vs one of the "weekend" days).

        POSIX.1 specifies F_SETOWN and F_GETOWN for sockets/SIGURG

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver  [Andi Kleen]
1e043959034888ce1b1a25346316d06f7d64f0fe perf_event_open.2 : PERF_SAMPLE_TRANSACTION support in Linux 3.13 (fwd)
            The following patch adds descriptions of the new perf_event_open.2
            PERF_SAMPLE_TRANSACTION sample type as added in Linux 3.13.

            The descriptions are based on information provided by Andi Kleen,
            both in the e-mail

                [PATCH 1/6] perf, core: Add generic transaction flags v5

            sent to the linux-kernel list as well as an e-mail

                [PATCH] Document transaction flags in perf_event_open manpage

            sent to the linux-man list.

            The implementation is based heavily on the Intel Haswell
            processor.  Documentation can be found at this page:
            http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/05/03/intelr-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intelr-tsx-profiling-with-linux-0
            as well as in section 18.11.5.1 of volume 3 of the
            Intel 64 and IA-32 Architecture Software Developer's Manual.

            Also, someone with better manpage formatting skills than I have
            should probably investigate why I can't get the last line of
            the change to properly tab-align with the .I transaction
            heading.

ferror.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        clearerr(), feof(), and ferror() are also POSIX-conformant

            described in
            http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0110.1/0506.html

            This functionality has been present since the beginning of the 2.6
            series. It's about time it gets documented.

            While I'm at it, also generally clarify the section on
            SIOCGIFCONF.
