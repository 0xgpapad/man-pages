        Add a PROLOG section:
            This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
            The Linux implementation of this interface may differ
            (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details
            of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented
            on Linux.

        Some formatting fixes, mostly to get rid of unwanted

Many many pages

        I noticed useless use of macros with alternating formatting
        (".IR" instead ".I" which suffices, ".BR" instead ".B", etc.)
        because there is only one element.  For example in ldconfig.8:

            -.BR /sbin/ldconfig
            +.B /sbin/ldconfig

        This is not very important, it only makes the sources more tidy.
        To find these I used:

            egrep '^\.(B[RI]|R[IB]|I[RB]) ([^ ]+|\"[^\"]\+\")$'

        And if you want to make these changes, you can use:

            sed 's/^\(\.[BRI]\)[BRI]\( \([^ ]\+\|\"[^\"]\+\"\)\)$/\1\2/g'
