New pages
---------

termio.7
    mtk, after a bit of prodding by Reuben Thomas
        A brief discussion of the old System V termio interface,
        with pointers to pages that will contain the information
        that the reader probably wants.

scripts/find_repeated_words.sh
    mtk
        Find consecutive duplicate words in a man page, some of
        which may me grammar errors.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Since 2.6.20, access() honours the MS_NOEXEC mount flag.
    Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto / mtk
        Improve ENOENT description.

clone.2
    mtk
        Added some detail to the prototype.
        Added some notes on IA-64's clone2().

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that EPOLLRDHUP appeared in kernel 2.6.17.

faccessat.2
    Justin Pryzby
        Various fixes as per Debian bug 411177.
        * s/effective/real/ in description test.
        * added <fcntl.h> to synopsis.
        * various other changes.

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Added a few words to note that RLIMIT_NPROC is really a limit on
        threads.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s%linux/aio.h%libaio.h% in SYNOPSIS.
        Changed return type from "long" to "int".

mbind.2
    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        Fix EINVAL description.
        See Debian bug 411777.
       
mincore.2
    Nick Piggin
        Kernel 2.6.21 fixes several earlier bugs in mincore().
    Nick Pollitt
        Remove words "of a file" -- mincore() is describing
        memory residence information, not properties of a file.
    mtk
        Rewrote various parts to make the page clearer.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Rewrote and reorganised various parts to be clearer.
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Removed text stating that mmap() never returns 0; that's 
        not true.

mount.2
    mtk / Val Henson
        Document MS_RELATIME, new in Linux 2.6.20.
    
open.2
    Andre Majorel / mtk
        On Linux, the error returned when opening a large file on a 
        32-bit system is actually EFBIG, not EOVERFLOW.

posix_fadvise.2
    Pádraig Brady
        Fix RETURN VALUE description: returns error number of failure.

rename.2
    mtk / Timo Sirainen
        Various improvements to DESCRIPTION.
        See Debian bug 416012.

semop.2
    mtk
        If sops contains multiple operations, then these are performed
        in array order.  All Unix systems that I know of do this,
        and some Linux applications depend on this behaviour.  SUSv3
        made no explicit statement here, but SUSv3 will explicitly 
        require this behaviour.
        Small rewording of explanation of "atomically".

signal.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix incorrect argument name in DESCRIPTION.
    mtk
        Small wording improvement.
        
socket.2
    Nicolas François
        Add reference to ipv6.7 page.
        
socketcall.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

splice.2
    Benjamin Gilbert
        Fix inconsistent argument names in SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION.

statvfs.2
    mtk
        Small wording clarification.

symlink.2
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Removed cryptic text under CONFORMING to referring to 
        "open(2) and NFS".  There is no relevant text in open.2 as 
        far as I (mtk) can see.

time.2
    mtk / Reuben Thomas
        Remove sentence "gettimeofday() obsoleting time() on 4.3BSD".
        This information is old, and probably no longer relevant.
        See Debian bug 403888.

write.2
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified discussion of /count == 0/ case.

ptrace.2
    Chuck Ebbert
        When the parent receives an event with PTRACE_EVENT_* set, 
        the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.  This 
        means the parent cannot do ptrace(PTRACE_CONT) with a signal 
        or ptrace(PTRACE_KILL).  kill() with a SIGKILL signal can be 
        used instead to kill the child process after receiving one 
        of these messages.
        
sched_setaffinity.2
    mtk
        Fix glibc version number in description of cpusetsize argument.
   
vfork.2
    mtk
        Stripped some excess/outdated text from the BUGS section.
        
basename.3
    mtk / Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto
        Add text to clarify that the pointer returned by these
        functions may be into some part of 'path'.

dlopen.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
    + Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" to example program.

fclose.3
    mtk
        Complete rewrite.  The existing page was hard to read,
        and the RETURN VALUE description seems to be wrong.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Added getopt() example program.
    mtk
        Add a few words to clarify the operation of the GNU-specific double-colon
        feature, which allows options to have optional arguments.
        See Debian bug352139.

glob.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix PROTOTYPE.

inet_network.3
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified description of inet_network().

log.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

log10.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

malloc.3
    Nicolas François
        Small rewording to mention calloc().
        
posix_openpt.3
    Martín Ferrari
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS; as per Debian bug 400971.
        Needs _XOPEN_SOURCE == 600; as per Debian bug 400975.
    Julien BLACHE
        s/ptsname/posix_openpt/ in RETURN VALUE
        
re_comp.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Add "#define _REGEX_RE_COMP" to SYNOPSIS.
        
regex.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

termios.3
    mtk
        Added .SS headers to give some structure to this page; and a small
        amount of reordering.
    mtk
        Added a section on canonical and non-canonical mode.
    mtk
        Enhanced the discussion of "raw" mode for cfmakeraw().
    mtk
        Document CMSPAR.
    mtk
        Make description of PARODD a little clearer.
    Reuben Thomas
        Add SEE ALSO link to tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO link to console_ioctl.4

ualarm.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

usleep.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

termcap.5
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s/curses/ncurses/ under SEE ALSO

bootparam.7
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Documented "mem=nopentium".

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        The default treatment of _POSIX_C_SOURCE changed in glibc 2.4.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Justin Pryzby
        Added some text warning that the "__" macros the
        <features.h> defines internally should never be
        directly defined by programs.
    mtk, based on notes by Jakub Jelinek
        Document _FORTIFY_SOURCE
        (See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html )
    mtk
        Document _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

mdoc.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Remove CONFIGURATION section, since this does not seem to be
        true for Linux.
        
svipc.7
    Nicolas François
        Fix data types in associated data structures; 
        remove non-existent semzcnt and semncnt fields.

time.7
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.20, the software clock can also be 300 HZ.
