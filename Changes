New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

rt_sigqueueinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephan Mueller]
        New page for rt_sigqueueinfo(2) and rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2)
            This replaces the previous '.so' man page link file for
            rt_sigqueueinfo.2, which linked to this sigqueue() man page.

cciss.4
    Stephen M. Cameron
        New man page for cciss driver
            I obtained the information in this man page as a consequence
            of having worked on the cciss driver for the past several years,
            and having written considerable portions of it.

hpsa.4
    Stephen M. Cameron
        New man page for the hpsa driver
            I obtained the information in this man page as a consequence

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 2.6.39 changes to rules governing changes from SCHED_IDLE policy
            Since Linux 2.6.39, unprivileged processes under the
            SCHED_IDLE policy can switch to another nonrealtime
            policy if their nice value falls within the range
            permitted by their RLIMIT_NICE limit.

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add rt_sigqueueinfo (2)

btowc.3, wctob.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Brian M. Carlson]
        Add pointers to better, thread-safe alternative functions
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=606899

fwide.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add _ISOC95_SOURCE to feature test macro requirements
            Since glibc 2.12, _ISOC95_SOURCE can also be used to expose
            prototype of this function.

index.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Fix text mentioning terminating null

pthread_sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace explicit mention of rt_tgsigqueueinfo() with SEE ALSO reference

sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move this page to section 3
            Now that the underlying system call rt_sigqueueinfo(2) is
            properly documented, move sigqueue() to Section 3, since
            it is really a library function.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update text in line with existence of new rt_sigqueueinfo.2 page

wcsnlen.3
    Jon Grant
        Improve description of 'maxlen' argument
            It's worth clarifying 'maxlen' is in wide-char units, not bytes.

wprintf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add _ISOC95_SOURCE to feature test macro requirements
            Since glibc 2.12, _ISOC95_SOURCE can also be used to expose
            prototype of these functions.

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document _ISOC95_SOURCE
            _ISOC95_SOURCE was added in glibc 2.12 as a means
            to expose C90 Amendment 1 definitions.

    Benjamin Poirier  [Neil Horman]
        Improve description of IP_MTU_DISCOVER
