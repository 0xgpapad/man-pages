    Jann Horn
        Pending CLONE_NEWPID prevents thread creation
    Michael Kerrisk

        Document FAN_OPEN_EXEC and FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Actual pipe capacity may in practice be less than nominal capacity
            The number of bytes that can be written to the pipe may be less

    Jann Horn  [Michal Hocko, William Kucharski]
        Fix description of treatment of the hint
            The current manpage reads as if the kernel will always pick a free

        Clarify that endmntent() should be used rather than fclose()

isatty.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jakub Wilk]

tzfile.5
    Paul Eggert
        Sync from tzdb upstream

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix some imprecisions in discussion of namespaced file capabilities
            The file UID does not come into play when creating a v3
            security.capability extended attribute.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that v3 security.attributes are transparently created/retrieved
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve the discussion of when file capabilities are ignored
            The text stated that the execve() capability transitions are not
            performed for the same reasons that setuid and setgid mode bits
            may be ignored (as described in execve(2)). But, that's not quite
            correct: rather, the file capability sets are treated as empty
            for the purpose of the capability transition calculations.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework bounding set as per-thread set in transformation rules
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantially rework "Capabilities and execution of programs by root"
            Rework for improved clarity, and also to include missing details
            on the case where (1) the binary that is being executed has
            capabilities attached and (2) the real user ID of the process is
            not 0 (root) and (3) the effective user ID of the process is 0
            (root).
    Marcus Gelderie
        Add details about SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
            The description of SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS is misleading about the
            effects on the effective capabilities of a process during a
            switch to nonzero UIDs.  The effective set is cleared based on
            the effective UID switching to a nonzero value, even if
            SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS is set. However, with this bit set, the
            effective and permitted sets are not cleared if the real and
            saved set-user-ID are set to nonzero values.
    Marcus Gelderie
        Mention header for SECBIT constants
            Mention that the named constants (SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS and others)
            are available only if the linux/securebits.h user-space header
            is included.
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a subsection on per-user-namespace "set-user-ID-root" programs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of exec and UID 0, correcting a couple of details
            Clarify the "Capabilities and execution of programs by root"
            section, and correct a couple of details:
            * If a process with rUID == 0 && eUID != 0 does an exec,
              the process will nevertheless gain effective capabilities
              if the file effective bit is set.
            * Set-UID-root programs only confer a full set of capabilities
              if the binary does not also have attached capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update URL for libcap tarballs
            The previous location does not seem to be getting updated.
            (For example, at the time of this commit, libcap-2.26
            had been out for two months, but was not present at
            http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify which capability sets capset(2) and capget(2) apply to
            capset(2) and capget(2) apply operate only on the permitted,
            effective, and inheritable process capability sets.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the description of SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add background details on capability transformations during execve(2)
            Add background details on ambient and bounding set when
            discussing capability transformations during execve(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the 'no_file_caps' kernel command-line option

cgroup_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Troy Engel]
        Clarify the example by making an implied detail more explicit.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201047

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on v2 'cpu' controller and realtime threads
            Explicitly note the scheduling policies that are relevant for the
            v2 'cpu' controller.

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the use of 'cgroup_no_v1=named' to disable v1 named hierarchies
            This feature was added in Linux 5.0.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Weilgart]
        Complete partial sentence re kernel boot options and 'nsdelegate'
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201029
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reframe the text on delegation to include more details about cgroups v1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Leah Hanson]
        Rework discussion of writing to cgroup.type file
            In particular, it is possible to write "threaded" to a
            cgroup.type file if the current type is "domain threaded".
            Previously, the text had implied that this was not possible.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Balbir Singh, Marcus Gelderie]
        Soften the discussion about delegation in cgroups v1
            Balbir pointed out that v1 delegation was not an accidental
            feature.

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Introduce the terms "interest list" and "ready list"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistently use the term "interest list" rather than "epoll set"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat Q&A list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that edge-triggered notification wakes up only one waiter
            Note a useful performance benefit of EPOLLET: ensuring that
            only one of multiple waiters (in epoll_wait()) is woken
            up when a file descriptor becomes ready.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand the discussion of the implications of file descriptor duplication
            In particular, note that it may be difficult for an application
            to know about the existence of duplicate file descriptors.

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Westfeld]
        Add more detail on why FTMs must be defined before including any header

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Paul Millar]
        Note ENOTDIR error that can occur for IN_ONLYDIR
            Note ENOTDIR error that occurs when requesting a watch on a
            nondirectory with IN_ONLYDIR.

ip.7
    Bert Hubert
        IP_RECVTTL error fixed
            I need to get the TTL of UDP datagrams from userspace, so I set
            the IP_RECVTTL socket option.  And as promised by ip.7, I then get
            IP_TTL messages from recvfrom.  However, unlike what the manpage
            promises, the TTL field gets passed as a 32 bit integer.

namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        List factors that may pin a namespace into existence
            Various factors may pin a namespace into existence, even when it
            has no member processes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tycho Kirchner]
        Briefly explain why CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to create nonuser namespaces
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pam_namespace(8)

pid_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the semantics for the adoption of orphaned processes
            Because of setns() semantics, the parent of a process may reside
            in the outer PID namespace. If that parent terminates, then the
            child is adopted by the "init" in the outer PID namespace (rather
            than the "init" of the PID namespace of the child).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note a detail of /proc/PID/ns/pid_for_children behavior
            After clone(CLONE_NEWPID), /proc/PID/ns/pid_for_children is empty
            until the first child is created. Verified by experiment.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that a process can do unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) only once
            (See the recent commit to the unshare(2) manual page.)

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eugene Syromyatnikov]

    Helge Deller
        Add signal numbers for parisc
    Michael Kerrisk
        Unify signal lists into a signal table that embeds standards info
            Having the signals listed in three different tables reduces
            readability, and would require more table splits if future
            standards specify other signals.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder the architectures in the signal number lists
            x86 and ARM are the most common architectures, but currently
            are in the second subfield in the signal number lists.
            Instead, swap that info with subfield 1, so the most

        Place signal numbers in a separate table
            The current tables of signal information are unwieldy,
            as they try to cram in too much information.

socket.7
unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text describing SO_PEERCRED from socket(7) to unix(7)
            This is, AFAIK, an option specific to UNIX domain sockets, so
            place it in unix(7).

        Enhance the description of SCM_RIGHTS
            The existing description is rather thin. More can be said.
    Michael Kerrisk
        There is a limit on the size of the file descriptor array for SCM_RIGHTS
            The limit is defined in the kernel as SCM_MAX_FD (253).

        Rework SO_PEERCRED text for greater clarity
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felipe Gasper]
        Clarify SO_PASSCRED behavior
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that SO_PASSCRED provides SCM_CREDENTIALS messages
    Michael Kerrisk
        If the buffer to receive SCM_RIGHTS FDs is too small, FDs are closed
    Michael Kerrisk
        One must send at least one byte of real data with ancillary data
    Michael Kerrisk
        Ancillary data forms a barrier when receiving on a stream socket
    Michael Kerrisk
        When sending ancillary data, only one item of each type may be sent
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording describing socket option argument/return values
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify treatment of incoming ancillary data if 'msg_control' is NULL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note behavior if buffer to receive ancillary data is too small
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix a minor imprecision in description of SCM_CREDENTIALS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to socket(7) for information about SO_PEEK_OFF

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework terminology describing ownership of nonuser namespaces
            Prefer the word "owns" rather than "associated with" when
            describing the relationship between user namespaces and non-user
            namespaces. The existing text used a mix of the two terms, with
            "associated with" being predominant, but to my ear, describing the
            relationship as "ownership" is more comprehensible.
