Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fcntl.2
   mtk, after a note by Mike Bianchi
       More clearly and consistently describe the whether
       or not the third argument to fnctl() is required,
       and what its type should be.
   mtk
       Move description of negative l_len  from NOTES, integrating
       it into the discussion of file locking.
       Minor rewrites of the text on file locking.

getrusage.2
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        Remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
        Add more detail in mount options that prevent updates to atime.

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Update kernel version numbers relating to real-time support.

stat.2
    H. Peter Anvin
        Note that lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
        action, whereas stat() will.

clock.3
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

clock_getres.3
    Tolga Dalman / mtk
        Add "Link with -lrt" to SYNOPSIS; remove now redundant
        sentence mentioning librt from NOTES.

getdate.3
    mtk
        Rewrite description of getdate_r() and integrate into main text
        (rather than describing in NOTES).
        Other parts rewritten for greater clarity.
        Make it clearer in the main text that glibc does not implement %Z;
        remove discussion of that point from NOTES.
        Added an example program.

hsearch.3
    mtk
        Noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
        Described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
        Added missing pieces to RETURN VALUE.
        Added a number of new entries under ERRORS.
        NOTES: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
        noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
        for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        One of the BUGS was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        Rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
        Rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
        glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Timothy S. Wayland
        Integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
        (rather than as a short paragraph at the end).

iconv.3
    Bruno Haible
        Describe "shift sequence" input.
      
ptsname.3
    sukadev
        Fix return type of ptsname_r() in SYNOPSIS.

readdir.3
    H. Peter Anvin
        s/stat(2)/lstat(2)/ when discussin d_type (since we
        are talking about a case where we might be interested to
        whether the file itself is a symbolic link).

sigsetops.3
    Chris Head, signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/

proc.5
    Mats Wichmann / mtk
        s/\[number]/[pid]/ in file names for /proc/PID files.
        And similar changes for task/[tid] sub-directories.
    mtk / Mats Wichmann
        In the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
        lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
        that related to this /proc file.
    Michael Schurter / mtk
        Remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
        info in bytes
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
        Note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
        statistics.
    Joe Korty
        Document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
        Linux 2.6.24.

unix.7
    Marko Kreen
        Since glibc 2.8, _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in order to get
        the definition of the ucred structure from <sys/socket.h>.
