    mtk
        NOTES: Summarize the state of glibc support for exceptions

Changes to individual pages (math functions)
--------------------------------------------

Almost all of the changes in this release relate to math man pages.
Very many changes were made to the math pages, including:

* Fixed feature test macros (FTMs).  Often, the FTM requirements
  for the "float" and "long double" versions of a math function are
  different from the requirements for the "double version".  Each math
  page now shows the correct FTM requirements for all three versions
  of the function(s) it describes.  This may have required either
  a change to the existing FTM text (if the requirements for the
  "double" function were already described), or the addition of an FTM
  description to a SYNOPSIS where one was not previously present
  (typically because the "double" version of the function does not
  require any FTMs to be defined).
* CONFORMING TO: in many cases, POSIX.1-2001 was not mentioned.
  Where a function is specified in POSIX.1-2001, this is now noted.
  Also, statements about what other standards a function conforms to
  were generally clarified.  (The wording about which functions conformed
  to C99 was previously often done as an add on sentence; now it is made
  part of the first sentence of the CONFORMING TO section, along with
  POSIX.1-2001.)
* RETURN VALUE: in many cases, pages lacked descriptions of the return
  value when the function arguments are special values such as +0, -0,
  NaN (not-a-number), +infinity, -infinity, etc.  This has been fixed.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the RETURN VALUE descriptions (and the POSIX.1-2001
  requirements).
* ERRORS: many pages lacked a clear (or indeed any) description of
  how errno is set on error and what exception is raised for each error.
  This has been fixed.  The ERRORS sections are now generally headed up
  as per the POSIX.1 way of doing things, describing Pole / Range /
  Domain errors, as applicable.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the ERRORS descriptions.  Deviations from POSIX.1-2001
  requirements have been filed as glibc bug reports, and noted in the
  man pages.  (The pages now describe the situation for ERRORS as at glibc
  2.8; I may eventually try and extend the text with descriptions of
  changes in older versions of glibc.)
  NOTE: one point that has not been covered in any page is the
  circumstances that generate inexact (FE_INEXACT) exceptions.
  (The details for these exceptions are not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
  and I haven't gone looking for the standards that describe the details.)
