        Various pages use inconsistent terms for 'null byte' (which
        is the C99/SUSv3 term for the '\0' character).

        To rectify this the following changes were made in the above 
        pages:
    
            Replace 'zero byte' with 'null byte'.
            Replace 'null character' with 'null byte'.
            Replace 'nulls' with 'null bytes'.
            Replace 'NUL-terminated' by 'null-terminated'.
            Replace 'NUL' by 'null byte'.
            Replace 'terminating NUL' by 'terminating null byte'.
            Replace 'final NUL' by 'terminating null byte'.
            Replace 'NUL character' by 'null byte'.

Various pages
    mtk
