Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fredrik Arnerup]
        Describe timeout limitation in kernels < 2.6.37
            As reported by Fredrik (and as far as I can tell the problem
            went back to 2.6.0):

            The timeout argument has an upper limit. Any values above that
            limit are treated the same as -1, i.e. to wait indefinitely.
            The limit is given by:

                #define EP_MAX_MSTIMEO min(1000ULL * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ, \
            	(LONG_MAX - 999ULL) / HZ)

            That is, the limit depends on the size of a long and the timer
            frequency.  Assuming the a long is never smaller than 32 bits
            and HZ never larger than 1000, the worst case is 35 minutes.
            I think this should be mentioned under "BUGS".

            Although this is likely to be fixed in the future
            (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/8/144), the problem exists in
            at least 2.6.14 - 2.6.35. I don't know if select(2) and poll(2)
            are affected.

            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20762
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Note Linux's odd handling of the new_value==NULL case
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Fix types used to declare fields in timeval struct

keyctl.2
    David Prévot
        Reorder SEE ALSO, without .br

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephane Fillod]
        Note behavior if monitored file descriptor is closed in another thread
            Executive summary: a sane application can't rely on any
            particular behavior if another thread closes a file descriptor
            being monitored by select().

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify equivalent pselect() code in terms of threads
            s/sigprogmask/pthread_sigmask/

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of blocking behavior in terms of threads
            semop() blocks the calling thread, not the process.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add clone(2)
            Give reader a clue about CLONE_SYSVSEM.

shutdown.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        Document EINVAL error (and associated bug)
            Eric Dumazet noted that EINVAL was not documented. Some further
            digging shows that it's also not diagnosed consistently.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47111.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak SA_RESETHAND description

syscalls.2, uname.2, boot.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/OS/operating system/

timer_settime.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording around discussion of pointer arguments

wait4.2
    Adrian Bunk
        Note that these functions are nonstandard and recommend alternatives
            Some edits to Adrian's path by mtk.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note SUS details for wait3()

gnu_get_libc_version.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded "#define _GNU_SOURCE" from SYNOPSIS

pthread_kill.3, pthread_sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove wording "another"
            Writing "another thread" in these pages implies that these
            functions can't be used to send a signal to the calling thread
            itself, which is of course untrue.

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "int" arg to sv_handler definition in sigvec structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix small error in discussion of blocking of signals
            The signal that causes the handler to be invoked is blocked,
            but saying "by default" implies that this can be changed via
            the API. It cannot. (One needs sigaction(2) for that.)

syslog.3
    Simon Josefsson
        Remove (apparently bogus) text claiming LOG_AUTH is deprecated
            LOG_AUTH is in POSIX, and widely available. There
            seems to be no basis to the claim it is deprecated.

            Quoting Simon:
                I cannot find any other source that claim LOG_AUTH is
                deprecated in any way.  LOG_AUTH is distinct from
                LOG_AUTHPRIV.  The GNU C Library manual only documents
                LOG_AUTH.  The header files contains both without any
                comment.  Common systems like Debian appear to refer to
                both auth and authpriv facilities in syslog configurations.
                Popular daemons appear to use both facilities.
                Both facilities are discussed in several RFCs.

ttyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add ctermid(3)

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify header file related to 'flags' field of /proc/PID/stat
    Michael Kerrisk  [Frédéric Brière]
        Update description of 'starttime' field of /proc/PID/stat
            The unit of measurement changed from jiffies to clock ticks in
            Linux 2.6.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=675891
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
    Michael Kerrisk [Kees Cook]
        Document /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks
            Based on text in Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt by Kees Cook
    Michael Kerrisk [Kees Cook]
        Document /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
            Based on text in Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt by Kees Cook

        SEE ALSO: Add icmp(7)

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some advice about disabling hyphenation in SEE ALSO

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe interpretation of slashes in dependency strings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Repeat note that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored in privileged programs
            This point is already noted when discussing search order for
            libraries, but it's worth repeating under the specific discussion
            of LD_LIBRARY_PATH further down the page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for LD_PRELOAD
        Note that LD_PRELOAD list separator can be space or colon
