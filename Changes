Global changes
--------------

Most of the changes below are about bringing greater consistency
to manual pages, including reducing the side wange of .SH 
Section headings.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Make 'manual' component of .TH line "Linux Programmer's Manual"
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed date in .TH line into form YYYY-DD-MM.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Some .SH header lines were made into .SS lines.  (One of the aims
        here is to reduce the number of non-standard .SH lines.)

Various pages
    mtk
        Change title .SH sections named "NOTE" to "NOTES", in some cases
        also changing the location of the section within the page.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Commented out .SH AUTHOR sections; the right place for 
        documentation authoriship sections is usually comments at the 
        top of the page source.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed .SH HISTORY to .SH VERSIONS.
        Reason: in many cases, HISTORY was being used to describe 
        Linux/glibc version innformation, as was already done for 
        VERSIONS sections in other pages.

Various pages
    mtk
       Removed HISTORY section, or moved it as a subsection or paragraphs
       under another section e.g., NOTES.
       Reason: there are too many arbitrary section (.SH) names, and
       a HISTORY section never was consistently used across Linux 
       manual pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Moved SEE ALSO section to be last section on the page
        Reason: consistency -- and this where SEE ALSO should be!

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated GLIBC NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated LINUX NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "AVAILABILIY" sections to "VERSIONS".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "DIAGNOSTICS" sections to "RETURN VALUE".
        Reason: consistency.

        program.
        Reason: consistency.

mprotect.2
select_tut.2
dlopen.3
getgrent_r.3
getopt.3
getpwent_r.3
hsearch.3
select_tut.2
tsearch.3

        to exit().
        Reason: consistency.

access.2
chown.2
lseek.2
open.2
read.2
utmp.5
    mtk
        Renamed RESTRICTIONS section to NOTES, or moved text in a 
        RESTRICTIONS section under existing NOTES section.
        Reason: consistency, and reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH)
        names.

        Minor wording and formatting changes.

encrypt.3
    mtk
        Removed statement that glibc unconditionally exposes declarations
        of encrypt() and setkey(), since portable applications must
        use <unistd.h> and define _XOPEN_SOURCE to obtain the declarations
        of setkey() and encrypt().  Adjusted example program accordingly.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Slight rewording.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

man.7

        Substantial rewrite, revising and extending the discussion

        man-pages releases.
