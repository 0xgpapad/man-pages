Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.


New pages
---------

timeradd.3
    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.
