Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getrusage.2
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        Remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
	
clock.3
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

hsearch.3
    mtk
	Noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
	Described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
	Added missing pieces to RETURN VALUE.
	Added a number of new entries under ERRORS.
	NOTES: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
	noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
	for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        One of the BUGS was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        Rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
	Rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
	glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Timothy S. Wayland
        Integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
	(rather than as a short paragraph at the end).

ptsname.3
    sukadev
        Fix return type of ptsname_r() in SYNOPSIS.

sigsetops.3
    Chris Head, signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/

proc.5
    Mats Wichmann / mtk
        s/\[number]/[pid]/ in file names for /proc/PID files.
	And similar changes for task/[tid] sub-directories.
    mtk / Mats Wichmann
        In the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
	lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
	that related to this /proc file.
    Michael Schurter / mtk
        Remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
	info in bytes
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
	Note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
	statistics.
    Joe Korty
        Document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
	Linux 2.6.24.

unix.7
    Marko Kreen
        Since glibc 2.8, _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in order to get
	the definition of the ucred structure from <sys/socket.h>.
