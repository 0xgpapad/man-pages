Changes to individual pages

ioperm.2

        Clarify discussion of privilege requirements.
        Added ENOMEM to ERRORS.

open.2
    mtk / Eduard Bloch

rtc.4
    David Brownell
        
        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:

        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.

        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.

        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.

        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.

        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.

        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.

    mtk
        s/fseek(3)/lseek(2)/ under /proc/PID/mem entry.
